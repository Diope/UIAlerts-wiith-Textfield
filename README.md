# UIAlerts with Textfields

I saw some app designs over on Dribbble (check out my rails clone [Drubbble](https://github.com/Diope/drubbble)!) and saw that you can indeed put textfields in your UIAlerts. Obviously I should have consulted Stack Overflow, but alas I did not. Ran into a tutorial that went over the basics, honestly. I'm slightly disappointed I was able to figure it out on my own, but alas what can you do?
